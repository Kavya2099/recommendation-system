Recommendation system based on content based filtering and collaborative based filtering

# Project 1 - Content based Movie recommendation from kaggle dataset
This is content based movie recommendation system by filtering the titles based on overview column from the Kaggle dataset using TfidfVectorizer and Cosine simularity

Dataset: "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata

# Project 2 - Content based Movie recommendation system
This is content based movie recommendation system by filtering the titles based on title column from the dataset.
Changed the movie title name to be easily used by ML using regular expression (or RE) and created the model using TfidfVectorizer and Cosine simularity

# Project 3 - Collaborative based Movie recommendation system
This is collaborative based movie recommendation system by filtering the titles based on ratings given by users and movies watched/liked by users from the dataset.
Created using pivot table and Cosine simularity. Also we have found top 50 popular movies from the dataset.
